# Getting Started

## Slack Bot

Slack provides bot users a service. Bot users have many of the same qualities as their human counterparts: they have profile photos, names, and bios, they exist in the team directory, they can be direct messaged or mentioned, they can post messages and upload files, and they can be invited to and kicked out of channels and private groups.

Every team has the ability to create their own custom bot users that they can use on their team. They do this by going to their team's settings page and [creating a new bot user](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot). If you'd like to distribute your bot user to other Slack teams, then you should attach it to a Slack app. This makes it much easier for teams to install via the Slack Button. Once you've added the integration to your team, you'll be granted a bot access token, which you'll use when connecting to our APIs as that bot user.

For more details, please consider reading the [bot users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) slack documentation.
